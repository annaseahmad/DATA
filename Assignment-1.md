### Individual assignment 1

#### Introduction

This assignment is a continuation of the example included in the lecture **[DATA-02] Linear regression**. As suggested in the Homework section, you have to develop a model for predicting prices using log scale. 

#### Tasks

1. Derive, from the data available, a linear regression equation that has the logarithm of the price on the left side.

2. Use this equation to predict the prices and evaluate the prediction errors.

3. Compare the performance of this predictive model with the model presented in the lecture.

#### Submission

Submit the code used to develop your predictive model, with comments and a brief conclusion liones at the end. 

#### Deadline

January 31 (Tuesday), 24:00.
